title: Web Deep Image Prior
---

[Here](https://warlock.ai/deepimageprior/) I created a web version of the Deep Image Prior algorithm ([Original project page](https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925()) that runs fully client-side using [TensorFlow.JS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs). It can be used for many purposes such as denoising, inpainting and super-resolution (not implemented yet). Here are some example results for inpainting:
